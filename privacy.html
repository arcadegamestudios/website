                    <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>

                        <br/><br/>
                        Please note that data stored locally on the user’s device (such as game progress or settings) may need to be removed manually by the device owner.

                    <h1>Product-specific policies</h1>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the general practices described above, the following sections describe data practices for individual Games.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="product">NumTrix - Math Number Puzzle</h2>
                    <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
                    <p>
                        We collect app activity, game-play and ad actions (e.g. level progress, ad-watched, etc.) and other diagnostic information (like device identifiers, approximate locations, advertising ID, etc.) for advertisements and analytics purposes only.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We may ask the user's date-of-birth (DOB) to ensure we comply with data safety and families' policy norms. 
                        This information is used to determine what Ads to show and whether or not device identifiers (e.g. Advertising ID) are shared with 3rd parties or not. 
                        The DOB itself is neither shared nor stored directly. 
                        Besides the above, we do not collect any other personally identifiable information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Data storage, deletion and security</h3>
                    <p>
                        All game progress and user preferences are stored on the device itself. 
                        They can be deleted any time by the user by going to <i>Settings</i> > <i>Discard data</i>.
                        Since we do not have access to the user's device, the user is responsible for securing their device and any data stored locally on the device.
                        <br/><br/>
                        No data is stored on our servers. Any app-activity, game-actions, etc. data collected for analytics and advertisement purposes are collected by 3rd party services like GameAnalytics and Google AdMob. We use this data to improve our products and deliver to you a personalized ad experience.
                    </p>
