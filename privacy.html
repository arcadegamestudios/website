Depending on the particular Game, this data may be stored on the device itself, or could be uploaded to our servers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                    </p>

                    <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use the collected information to:

                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Data Storage</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Local Storage:</b> Some Games store all data (such as progress, preferences, or settings) only on your device.</li>
                            <li><b>Server Storage:</b> Some Games may store data (such as account details or gameplay progress) on our servers. We use only reputed third-party cloud service providers for this storage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Data Deletion</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can delete your data at any time from within the Game by going to <em>Settings</em> > <em>Discard Data</em>.
                        This will remove data stored locally on your device and, where applicable, from our servers. (Note: Some deletions may require Internet connectivity to complete.)
                        <br/><br/>
                        For data collected by third-party services such as <b>Google AdMob</b> (advertising) and <b>GameAnalytics</b> (analytics), we do not control this data directly. 
                        If you wish to request deletion of data stored by these services, you may do so by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Managing your Google advertising settings through your <b>Google Account</b>, in line with Google’s privacy policies.</li>
                            <li>
                                Contacting us at the email address mentioned below (in the <em>Contact Us</em> section) so we can assist with forwarding your request to <b>GameAnalytics</b>, in accordance with their privacy policy. 
                                <b>Please note that as GameAnalytics data for minors is anonymized/aggregated, it may not be possible to identify or delete specific records once they are processed.</b>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Third-Party Services & Data Processors</h3>
                    <p>
                        To provide a high-quality experience, we work with the following third-party service providers. While we process your age range locally on your device to ensure compliance, these services may receive technical identifiers (such as an Advertising ID or IP address) depending on your age and consent:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Google AdMob &mdash; </b>
                                Used for displaying advertisements. 
                                For users above the age of consent, this may include personalized ads. 
                                For users identified as minors, we programmatically disable behavioral tracking and personalized advertising. 
                                See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>GameAnalytics &mdash; </b>
                                Used to analyze app usage and improve game performance. 
                                For users identified as minors, we ensure that data collection is restricted to non-identifiable, aggregated metrics.
                                See <a href="https://gameanalytics.com/privacy">GameAnalytics Privacy Policy</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies. 
                        You can manage your consent or reset your identifiers at any time via the "Privacy Settings" option (under "Settings") within the App.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. Children's and Minor's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>
                        We take the safety of young users very seriously. 
                        To comply with GDPR, COPPA, and US state laws, we use a local "Age Gate" to determine the appropriate privacy settings for each user. 
                        <em>The date of birth you enter is processed and stored strictly on your device; it is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Children (Under 13):</b> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. For these users, we set the "Child-Directed" flag (TFCD) and restrict ad content to a "General" rating. All behavioral tracking and advertising identifiers are disabled.</li>
                            <li><b>Minors (13 to 17):</b> For users in this range, we apply "High Privacy" defaults. We set the "Under Age of Consent" flag (TFUA) and restrict ad content to a "Teen" rating. Personalized advertising is disabled by default for these users.</li>
                            <li><b>Data Removal:</b> Because we do not store your information on our servers, you can exercise your "Right to be Forgotten" by using the "Discard data" button in the app settings or by uninstalling the app. This will permanently wipe all locally stored progress and age-related flags.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. 
                        We use encryption to protect your data in transit, however, do note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
                        We restrict access to personal information to our organizational members, contractors and agents who need that information to process it, and are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8. Your Rights</h3>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accessing your data (if stored on our servers).</li>
                            <li>Requesting deletion of your data (if stored on our servers). For data stored locally on the device, you can manually delete that data from Settings > Discard data.</li>
                            <li>Opting out of personalized ads (depending on your region).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Additional US State Privacy Rights</h3>
                        <p>
                            Residents of certain US states (including California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, and Florida) have specific rights regarding their data:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Right to Opt-Out of Profiling:</b> We do not use your data for automated profiling that has legal effects.</li>
                                <li><b>Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing:</b> We do not "sell" your personal information. We only share data with service providers (AdMob/GameAnalytics) as described in Section 5.</li>
                                <li><b>Sensitive Data:</b> We do not collect "Sensitive Personal Information" (like precise geolocation or biometrics).</li>
                                <li><b>Minor Safety:</b> For users under 18, we apply "High Privacy" settings by default, including disabling personalized ads and restricting data collection to essential gameplay metrics.</li>
                            </ul>

                            Please reach out to us if you have any queries on the above.

                    <h1>Product-specific policies</h1>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the general practices described above, the following sections describe data practices for individual Games.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="product">NumTrix - Math Number Puzzle</h2>
                    <h3>1. Information we process</h3>
                    <p>
                        We prioritize data minimization. The information processed within our Games falls into two categories:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Age Verification (Local Only):</b> We may ask for your date of birth (DOB) to ensure we comply with international data safety laws (such as GDPR and COPPA). This DOB is processed strictly on your device. We do not store the DOB itself; we only store a general age-range flag locally to determine appropriate privacy settings. This information is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>App Activity & Technical Identifiers:</b> We use third-party tools to collect information about game-play (e.g., level progress, ad views) and device-specific technical data (e.g., approximate location, device identifiers, and Advertising ID).
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>For Adults:</b> This data is used for analytics and to provide a personalized advertising experience.</li>
                                    <li><b>For Minors:</b> Behavioral tracking and Advertising IDs are programmatically disabled. Data collection is restricted to basic app-performance metrics and non-personalized, age-appropriate advertisements.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Data Storage, Deletion and Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        We operate on a "Local-First" architecture to maximize user privacy:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Storage:</b> All game progress, user preferences, and age-related flags are stored directly on your device. <b>We do not host user accounts or store your data on our servers.</b></li>
                            <li><b>Deletion (Right to Erasure):</b> You have full control over your data. You can delete all locally stored information at any time by navigating to Settings > Discard Data. Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data.</li>
                            <li><b>Third-Party Data:</b> Data collected by our partners (Google AdMob and GameAnalytics) is managed according to their respective privacy policies. We do not have access to the raw identifiers they collect.</li>
                            <li><b>Security:</b> As your data is stored locally, the security of your game progress depends on the security of your mobile device. We recommend using standard device protections (passcodes, biometric locks) to secure your information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                                <b>App Activity & Technical Identifiers:</b> We use third-party tools to collect information about game-play (e.g., level progress, ad views) and device-specific technical data (e.g., approximate location, device identifiers, and Advertising ID).

                                    <li><b>For Adults:</b> This data is used for analytics and to provide a personalized advertising experience.</li>
                                    <li><b>For Minors:</b> Behavioral tracking and Advertising IDs are programmatically disabled. Data collection is restricted to basic app-performance metrics and non-personalized, age-appropriate advertisements.</li>

                    <h3>2. Data Storage, Deletion and Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        We operate on a "Local-First" architecture to maximize user privacy:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Storage:</b> All game progress, user preferences, and age-related flags are stored directly on your device. <b>We do not host user accounts or store your data on our servers.</b></li>
                            <li><b>Deletion (Right to Erasure):</b> You have full control over your data. You can delete all locally stored information at any time by navigating to Settings > Discard Data > Wipe. Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data.</li>
                            <li><b>Third-Party Data:</b> Data collected by our partners (Google AdMob and GameAnalytics) is managed according to their respective privacy policies. We do not have access to the raw identifiers they collect.</li>
                            <li><b>Security:</b> As your data is stored locally, the security of your game progress depends on the security of your mobile device. We recommend using standard device protections (passcodes, biometric locks) to secure your information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
