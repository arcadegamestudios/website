                    <h1>Product-specific policies</h1>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the general practices described above, the following sections describe data practices for individual Games.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="product">NumTrix</h2>
                    <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>
                    <p>
                        We collect app activity, game-play and ad actions (e.g. level progress, ad-watched, etc.) and other diagnostic information (like device identifiers, approximate locations, etc.) for advertisements and analytics purposes only.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We do not collect any personally identifiable information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Data storage, deletion and security</h3>
                    <p>
                        All game progress and user preferences are stored on the device itself. 
                        They can be deleted any time by the user by going to <i>Settings</i> > <i>Discard data</i>.
                        Since we do not have access to the user's device, the user is responsible for securing their device and any data stored locally on the device.
                        <br/><br/>
                        No data is stored on our servers. Any app-activity, game-actions, etc. data collected for analytics and advertisement purposes are collected by 3rd party services like GameAnalytics and Google AdMob. We use this data to improve our products and deliver to you a personalized ad experience.
                    </p>
